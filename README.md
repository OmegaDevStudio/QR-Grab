# QR-Grab

A discord bot, QR code token grabber.

## About

A python script that automatically generates a QR Code using discords Remote-OAuth gateway. This works through a discord bot, using the discord.py library. Unlike many other QR Code token grabbers, this comes with a full fledged discord bot, while also not having the need for selenium. Please use at your own risk.

## Set Up

Place token where it states in main.py, run the file and should work. Please remember to install any imports that are required. There is probably more I can do for user customisation, e.g changing the name of the bot and whatnot, however this is pretty simple and you probably are big brain.
